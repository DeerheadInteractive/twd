[REDACTED] is a cyberpunk tower defense that takes place in the near future where nanomachines are used to cure diseases. The core mechanics of traditional TDs are present, but with a few unique twists. The player controls a support character that can buff towers in close proximity or debuff enemies and the potency of these effects can be upgraded using Nanites. Nanites can also be used to upgrade tower attributes, such as damage and fire rate. All the sounds and music in [REDACTED] have been custom crafted by the team here at Deerhead Interactive.
